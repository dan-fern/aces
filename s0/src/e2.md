## ACES Newsletter 0.2

Welcome to the Navi Robotics ACES Newsletter, focussing on the autonomous, connected, electric, and shared subset of new mobility and future transportation.   

### Spotlight -- Waymo??

Last week, [Waymo dropped a massive amount of data on its autonomous vehicle operations in Phoenix, Arizona](https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google). This data dump offers insight into more than just the number of crashes — 18 — or near misses — 29 — over the past 20 months. It provides the first real detailed look at Waymo’s automated system and operations.

The company published two papers detailing its safety methodologies and readiness as well as public road safety performance data, which analyzes the miles Waymo has driven on public roads in Arizona. The first paper digs into its three layered approach to safety, which includes the hardware, the automated driving system behavior and operations.

I’m still reading through the papers and will add more thoughts on this soon, but in the meantime here are my two big takeaways.

    Waymo is finally providing a detailed answer to questions I have asked the company, including its CTO Dmitri Dolgov, which is “how safe is safe enough?” and “how do you know when it is safe enough?”
    Automated vehicle technology companies are starting to compete on transparency.

    In its first report on its autonomous vehicle operations in Phoenix, Arizona, Waymo said that it was involved in 18 crashes and 29 near-miss collisions during 2019 and the first nine months of 2020.
    These crashes included rear-enders, vehicle swipes, and even one incident when a Waymo vehicle was T-boned at an intersection by another car at nearly 40 mph. The company said that no one was seriously injured and “nearly all” of the collisions were the fault of the other driver.



#### Further Reading on Waymo??:
* [Daimler Trucks and Waymo have signed a broad, global, strategic partnership](https://www.daimler.com/investors/reports-news/financial-news/20201027-dt-and-waymo.html) to deploy autonomous SAE L4 technology. Their initial effort will combine Waymo’s automated driver technology with a unique version of Daimler’s Freightliner Cascadia, to enable autonomous driving.
The autonomous Freightliner Cascadia truck, equipped with the Waymo Driver, will be available to customers in the U.S. in the coming years. Waymo and Daimler Trucks will investigate expansion to other markets and brands in the near future.

This is Waymo’s first deal in the freight business.

### Industry Quick Hits

* Busy busy bee [Daimler Trucks invests in LiDAR developer Luminar](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/30/daimler-invests-in-lidar-company-luminar-in-push-to-bring-autonomous-trucks-to-highways/) to better equip their internal Torc Robotics teams. If the Waymo deal is one attack plan for Daimler, then the Luminar/Torc one is a separate second one. Maybe still it's an insurance policy. Either way you slice it, the writing from the German automaker is on the wall and it's clearly downplaying robotaxis and shared mobility in favor of applying automated vehicle technology to freight.

* [Motional partners with Via on robo-taxi service](https://venturebeat.com/2020/10/27/motional-partners-with-via-to-launch-a-robo-taxi-service-in-the-u-s/). Motional, a joint self-driving research collaboration between Aptiv and Hyundai, will connect Motional’s driverless vehicles with Via’s technology that powers booking, routing, passenger and vehicle assignment and identification, customer experience, and fleet management.

* [Cadillac's Supercruise is the best driver assistance system, per Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/car-safety/cadillac-super-cruise-outperforms-other-active-driving-assistance-systems/). In its evaluations, CR compared performance of a vehicles’ active driving assistance, or when adaptive cruise control (ACC) and lane keeping assistance (LKA) are engaged simultaneously, in five specific categories: capability and performance, driver engagement, ease of use, clear when safe to use, and how to handle an unresponsive driver.
Results were:
    1. Cadillac Supercruise
    1. Tesla Autopilot
    1. Lincoln / Ford Co Pilot 360
    1. Audi Pre-Sense
    1. Hyundai Smart Sense / Kia Drive Wise
    1. Mercedes Driver Assistance
    1. Subaru Eyesight
    1. BMW Active Driving Assistance Pro
    1. Porsche Active Safe
    1. Volvo Pilot Assist
    1. Honda Sensing
    1. Nissan ProPilot Assist
    1. Toyota / Lexus Safety Sense 2.0
    1. Volkswagen
    1. Jaguar Land Rover
    1. Buick Driver Confidence
    1. Mazda i-ActiveSense


* [Fisker Inc. goes public via SPAC](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/30/electric-vehicle-start-up-fisker-surges-13percent-in-nyse-debut.html). It’s worth noting that Fisker doesn’t produce vehicles and doesn't generate revenue yet, although recently did land an agreement with Magna to manufacture its first vehicle, the Ocean SUV, which it has said will begin to deliver in 2022.

* [Yard trucking AV startup Outrider lands $65M Series B](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/28/outrider-raises-65-million-to-bring-its-autonomous-tech-to-distribution-yards/), just eight months after coming out of stealth. The round brings its total funding raised to $118 million.

* [Magna announces CLEARVIEW driver-monitoring system for 2022](https://www.magna.com/company/newsroom/releases/release/2020/10/27/news-release---magna-s-clearview-camera-monitoring-system-to-debut-in-2022). The interior mirror features a frameless design with the ability to electronically switch between a traditional rear-view mirror and a video display with a customizable field of view for up to three simultaneous camera views.

* Capitalizing on growing electric bike demand, [Harley-Davidson spins out its own e-bike business](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/27/harley-davidson-is-getting-into-the-electric-bicycle-business/), targeting release for Spring 2021.

* A week after getting a new leadership team, LiDAR startup AEye [lands minority investment from Continental](https://www.forbes.com/sites/greggardner/2020/10/27/continental-ag-takes-stake-in-aeye-to-enhance-its-autonomous-vehicle-technology/), eyeing a volume production launch for late 2024. With its stake in AEye, Conty is further complementing its existing close-range LiDAR technology.

* [Tesla raised the price](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/29/tesla-has-increased-the-price-of-its-full-self-driving-option-to-10000/) of its FSD software (short for “full self-driving, and no it’s not actual self driving) to $10,000. The FSD package, which owners can opt for, has been steadily rising over the past year. The price increase comes just a few days after the company started to roll out a beta version of the software update. To be clear, FSD is not what the industry or NHTSA defines as Level 4 autonomy per standards defined by SAE International. **Tesla vehicles with FSD require supervision at all times** and a human driver must be ready to take over — and if you’ve seen any of the videos, then yep, they sure need to take over. Level 4 under SAE standards require no driver intervention in certain conditions.
