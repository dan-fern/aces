Welcome to the Navi Robotics ACES Newsletter, focussing on the autonomous, connected, electric, and shared subset of new mobility and future transportation.   

### Spotlight -- Tesla "F"SD

Tesla announced that they were rolling out the "full self-driving" feature last week and, like most things Tesla, it got it's share of buzz. The "full" here is pretty problematic; because there's no governing body for the marketing of ADAS features, the name -- and ensuing confusion -- is allowed to stand.  Let's be clear about one thing: this is not self-driving, it is a highly-capable, vision-based ADAS system.  It is intended to be used under, and exclusively under, human supervision.  The problem lay in how few people know that.  Couple them with the cult of Elon, and you have a sizable population of road users either willfully or unknowingly working part-time as beta testers for Tesla's software org, where the test environment is our public roads, and the participants are pedestrians, bicyclists, and other road users.

Everyone in this space lobbed their share of criticism: Ed Neidermeyer at PAVE was critical of Tesla glossing over the need for safety drivers and instead passing that off to their customers.  Reilly Brennan begged the marketing angle saying, "Tesla has built one of the best ADAS systems in the world, or perhaps one of the most problematic AV systems. Which one is it?"  Alex Roy (for the umpteenth time) pointed at the lack of DMS precluding any claim of "self-driving".  These are all good points, but I think [Oliver Cameron at Voyage summed it up best in this thread](https://twitter.com/olivercameron/status/1319835514887831552).

###### Key Takeaways:
* Tesla ADAS doesn't use LiDAR, a high-fidelity layer of sensory information that has been empirically proven to be critical for L4 autonomy.
* Tesla ADAS doesn't use pre-loaded HD maps, so rather than knowing the vehicle is intersecting a one-way street, it must infer that, injecting risk.
* Companies don't add sensory layers because they want to add cost; they do it because real-time inference is an exceptionally-hard problem.
* Tesla has built a remarkably capable ADAS system, just please market it as such. And add DMS!!

### Industry Quick Hits

* [Foxconn launches MIH electic vehicle platform](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/16/foxconn-wants-to-become-the-android-for-electric-cars.html) to be the "Android for electic vehicles".  Their goal is for 10% of all EVs to be running MIH by 2025-2027, which sounds optimistic, but with them building 80% of a vehicle, consider how many more EVs this platform could enable.  Per Reilly Brennan, "There are now so many different entities involved in electric vehicles that the value isn't just moving from the traditional car industry, it is fundamentally pivoting around the new critical axes of battery, chips and electrical architecture."  
* [More on China's globally-focussed electic car strategy](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/23/chinas-electric-car-strategys-implications-for-us-energy-security.html).  "In just one sign of how far ahead China has progressed in electric vehicle development, out of 142 lithium-ion battery megafactories under construction globally, 107 are set for China, versus 9 in the U.S."
* [GM announces 2022 Hummer EV](https://jalopnik.com/every-engineering-detail-i-know-about-the-2022-hummer-e-1845453271).  As a child of the 90's, the thought of a rebooted Hummer is a bit cringeworthy, but this truck looks remarkably engineered: 1,000 horsepower, a 350-mile range, and 11,500 lb-ft of wheel torque for $112,595.  Yes, it's a brand experiment but I am unapologetically impressed.
* [Applied Intuition lands $125M Series C](https://blog.applied.co/blog-post/announcing-series-c-funding-from-existing-investors-lux-capital-andreessen-horowitz-and-general-catalyst), further corroborating that the key to successful AV deployment begins and ends with high-fidelity simulation.
* [Proterra raises $200M](https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/15/proterra-which-makes-big-honkin-battery-systems-and-electric-buses-raises-200-million/) to develop battery systems for heavy-duty electric vehicles.
* In the wake of COVID-19 and later-than-expected AV deployments, [Teleops providers look to warehouses and construction for customers](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54431056).
* [Dongfeng to build China's largest AV demonstration zone](http://autonews.gasgoo.com/m/70017654.html) in Wuhan, Hubei.  Capacity is at least 200 vehicles.  Collaborators include AutoX, DeepRoute.ai, and UISEE.
* [LiDAR firm AEye has a new leadership team](https://www.aeye.ai/press/aeye-appoints-blair-lacorte-as-ceo-luis-dussan-named-president-and-cto/).
* Chile, who holds 50% of the world's lithium reserves, [announces unfettered production in the face of  expanded environmental regulations](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-09/the-saudi-arabia-of-lithium-has-a-calming-message-for-car-makers).
* [Lecture notes and course outline](https://course.ece.cmu.edu/~ece642/) for Phil Koopman's (Edge Case Research) course on embbedded software engineering at CMU.  Guests include John Maddox and Reilly Brennan.
* [The Future of Law & Transportation](https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/symposium/) by Gregory Shill of the University of Iowa
